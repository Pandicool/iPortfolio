            <h3>Why is the DOCTYPE important?</h3>
            <p>
                The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE, is
                the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document.<br>The
                DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about
                what version of HTML the page is written in.<br>This ensures
                that the web page is parsed the same way by different web
                browsers.
